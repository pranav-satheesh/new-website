Cosmological simulations have a spatial resolution below which you cannot resolve processes of supermassive black hole dynamics. After a galaxy merger, the massive black hole binary inspirals towards each other and various environmental effects of the merger host contributes to the hardening of the binary. I work on models that incorporate such physical effects.
