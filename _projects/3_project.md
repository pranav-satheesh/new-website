The massive black hole binaries are sources of low frequency gravitational waves (GW) which will be observed in the millihertz band by LISA in the future. Pulsar timing arrays like NANOGrav will see a stochastic background of merging supermassive black hole binaries at the nanohertz band. 

In my undergrad research, I worked on GWs from stellar mass binaries observable by LIGO. I worked on modeling gravitational waveforms for detection by LIGO {% cite Paul_2025 %}
