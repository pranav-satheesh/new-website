Using cosmological simulation we can characterize the host galaxies of massive black hole mergers. Galaxy mergers are observed to correlate with enhancement in properties such as specific star formation and black hole accretion rates in simulations. We use the simulations to comparing mergers and non-mergers and identify specific characteristics of merger hosts.
