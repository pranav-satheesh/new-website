## Science comics and writing

I love making comics illustrating aspects of supermassive black holes, galaxy evolution and gravitational waves. You can find my comic on massive black hole formation published [here](https://sciwri.club/archives/13482) in ClubSciWri. 

*I'm working on a seperate page for my comics* :-)

I volunteered as a writer for [Astrobites](https://astrobites.org/) (2023-2025). Astrobites cover astrophysical literature and present it in format accessible to undergraduate students in the physical sciences who are interested in active research. You can find all of my articles [here](https://astrobites.org/author/psatheesh/).



## Science talks and workshops

<img src="/assets/img/talk1.jpeg" alt="my_talk" style="float: right; margin: 1rem 1rem; max-width: 400px; height: auto; border-radius: 4px;">

These are talks I have given at UF Physics as part of the Graduate Student Postdoc Seminar organized by the [Physics Graduate Community](https://www.phys.ufl.edu/wp/index.php/graduate/physics-graduate-community/).

- **Scripting the origin story of supermassive black holes**, Sep 2024
- **It takes three to tango: Massive black hole triples and the final parsec problem**, Sep 2023

During my undergrad, I got to organize several lecture presentations and workshops. Below is a list of some of them.

- **Relativity and Gravitation**, [*Horizon summer school 2021*](https://github.com/HorizonIITM/summer-school-2021), March 2020
- **Physics of Compact Stars**, *Boltzmann Session*, April 2020
- **Analysis of Globular Clusters Using Colour-Magnitude Diagrams**. *Shaastra 2020, IITM*, Jan 2020
- **Universe on your computer**, [*Sampark Workshop 2019*](https://github.com/pranav-satheesh/Sampark_Workshop), Oct 2019
- **Surfing gravitational waves**, *Astro Week*, Aug 2019 
- **An introduction to Astronomy**, Sep 2018

#### Lectures on Youtube

I made a set of lectures on Python for Astronomy that aims to teach application of Python programming language in various aspects of Astronomy research. I could cover topics such as handling FITS files, making Color-Magnitude diagrams, curve-fitting and modeling data. The video playlist is available [here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2rHXmvrOZXbQviht65mZSOW0_s1ZPpLA).
 

## Astronomy outreach

During my time as an undergrad at IIT Madras, I was fortunate to be part of several outreach activities as part of [Horizon: the physics and astronomy club](https://horizoniitm.github.io/). I served as the head during 2019-2020. Checkout the club website for --> [photos](https://horizoniitm.github.io/gallery/).
