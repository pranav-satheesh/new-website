Hello there! Welcome to my website!

I am a PhD student in Physics at [University of Florida](https://www.phys.ufl.edu/wp/), working with [Dr. Laura Blecha](http://www.phys.ufl.edu/~lblecha/) on supermassive black holes and galaxy evolution. I am also an associate member of [NANOGrav](https://nanograv.org/). For a detailed summary of my research and projects, checkout the [projects page](/projects/). Previously, I did a BS-MS in Physics at [Indian Institute of Technology Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) where I was involved in modelling gravitational waveforms for binary black holes. 

I am actively involved science communication and outreach. I volunteered as science-writer for Astrobites. I also make science-comics! You can check them out here. I also have a [blog](/blog/) which I plan to update periodically.
