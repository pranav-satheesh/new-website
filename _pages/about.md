Hi! Welcome to my website!


I am a PhD student in Physics at [University of Florida](https://www.phys.ufl.edu/wp/), working with [Dr. Laura Blecha](http://www.phys.ufl.edu/~lblecha/) on supermassive black holes and galaxy evolution. For a detailed summary of my research and projects, checkout the [research page](projects). Previously, I did a BS-MS Physics at [Indian Institute of Technology Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) where I was involved in modelling gravitational waveforms for binary black holes. 

I am very active in science communication and outreach and volunteer as a science-writer for Astrobites. I also make science-comics! You can check them out here.
