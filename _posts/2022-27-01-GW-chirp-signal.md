The gravitational waveform from inspiralling binaries is known as a *chirp waveform*. The amplitude and the frequency of the waveform increases with time and hence it is called a chirp (similar to a bird's chirp). Here I'll go through the steps to compute a simple waveform for inspiralling binaries in Python. 

## Setup

I will be using *Numpy* for calculations, *Matplotlib* for plotting and *Astropy* for using some constants (like $c, G$). You can install these packages using pip by clicking the link below. (Note that *Astropy* can be avoided for this exercise and the constant values can be hardcoded directly.)

  - Numpy installation
  - Matplotlib installation
  - Astropy installation

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from astropy import constants as const
```
Using the `constants` module we will define the constants reuired for this computation

```python
G = const.G.value #gravitational constant
c = const.c.value #speed of light
Msun = const.M_sun.value  #Mass of Sun
pc = const.pc.value #parsec
Mpc = 10**6 * pc 
```
## Frequency evolution

Now that we have the setup ready, we will look at the frequency evolution ($f$ vs $t$) for the waveform. From the theory of inspiralling binaries emiting GWs (I'm making a series of posts on that too!) we get $\dot{f}$ as,

$$  \frac{df}{dt} = \frac{96}{5} \frac{c^3}{G} \frac{f}{M_c} \Bigl( \frac{G}{c^3} \pi f M_c\Bigr)^{8/3}$$

where the chirp mass $M_c$ is given by $\frac{(m1 \ m2)^{3/5}}{(m_1 + m_2)^{1/5}}$. This equation can then be integrated to get $t(f)$ :

$$
t = t_c - \frac{3}{256} \Bigl( \frac{c^3}{G M_c}\Bigr)^{5/3} (\pi f)^{-8/3}
$$
Here $t_c$ denotes the time of coalescence and it is completely arbitary (We'll take $t_c = 0$). The equation tells us how close we are to the merger time. This can be now coded u

```python

  #chirp mass
  def Mchirp(m1,m2):
    return (m1*m2)**(3/5) * (m1+m2)**(-1/5)

  #parameters
  m1 = 30 * Msun
  m2 = 30 * Msun
  Mc = Mchirp(m1,m2)
  D = 1*Mpc

  f0 = 10 #starting frequency
  freq = np.linspace(f0,50,100)
  tc = 0.0 #merger time (s)

  def tau(f,Mc):
    return (3/156) * (c**3/(G*Mc))**(5/3) * (np.pi * f)**(-8/3)4

  time = tc - tau(freq,Mc)
```
We can now plot $f$ vs $t$ and compare it with the kind of behaviour that you expect from a gravitational waveform.

```python
tduration = time[-1] - time[0] #duration of the signal
torder = time - time[0] #rearranging the time array such that the t0 = 0 and merger time is tduration

plt.figure()
plt.xlabel("time (s)")
plt.ylabel("frequency (Hz)")
plt.title("Frequency evolution of binaries")
plt.grid()
```

This is similar to the Timeâ€“frequency plots that we usualy plot for a detection like the one below for GW190412. The frequency is expected to increase as the GWs are emitted away, the orbital frequency increases.

## The Chirp Signal

Now that we have plotted the time-frequency plot, the next step would be to visualise the chirp signal. The waveform is define by 

 1. Amplitude :

 $$ \mathcal{A} = 4 \frac{G M_c}{c^2 D} \Bigl( \frac{G}{c^3} \pi f M_c\Bigr)^{8/3}$$

 2. Phase:

$$ \phi(t) = 2 \pi \Bigl( f t + \frac{1}{2} \dot{f} t^2 \Bigr) + \phi_{0}$$

$\dot{f}$ is defined above and $\phi_{0}$ is the initial phase of the binary. The waveform is then 

$$h(t) = \mathcal{A} \,cos \phi(t)$$

Now for plotting, we will use the above frequency series and using the $t(f)$ we can calculate $t$ which then can be used to compute $\phi(t)$ and in turn $h(t)$.

```python
def h(Mc,D,f):
    
    #Amplitude
    h0 = 4*G*c**(-2)*Mc/D * (G*c**(-3) * np.pi * f*Mc)**(2/3)
    fdot = dfdt(f,Mc)
    t = tc - tau(f,Mc)
    
    #phase
    phi = 2*np.pi*f*t + np.pi*fdot*t**2+phi0
    
    return (t,h0*np.cos(phi))

freq = np.linspace(f0,100,5000)


t,hstrain = h(Mc,D,freq)
plt.figure()
plt.plot(t-t[0],hstrain)
plt.grid()
plt.xlabel("time(s)")
plt.ylabel("h(t)")
plt.title("A simple chirp signal")

```

This is a simple *chirp waveform* that we have computed. As you can see the amplitude and the frequency of the waveform increases with time.
